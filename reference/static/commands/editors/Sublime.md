## Why Sublime?

#### Sublime Text is built from custom components, providing for unmatched responsiveness. 

From a powerful, custom cross-platform UI toolkit, to an unmatched syntax highlighting engine, Sublime Text sets the bar for performance

#### It supports auto completion for all languages (Javascript, Java, C++, Python, you name it).

It might not sound like a important feature at the beginning. However, it becomes really helpful when you start to have more than just one language in the project.

#### MULTIPLE SELECTIONS

Make ten changes at the same time, not one change ten times. Multiple selections allow you to interactively change many lines at once, rename variables with ease, and manipulate files faster than ever.

Try pressing Ctrl+Shift+L to split the selection into lines and Ctrl+D to select the next occurrence of the selected word. To make multiple selections with the mouse, take a look at the Column Selection documentation.

#### COMMAND PALETTE

The Command Palette holds infrequently used functionality, like sorting, changing the syntax and changing the indentation settings. With just a few keystrokes, you can search for what you want, without ever having to navigate through the menus or remember obscure key bindings.

Show the Command Palette with Ctrl+Shift+P.

#### SPLIT EDITING

Get the most out of your wide screen monitor with split editing support. Edit files side by side, or edit two locations in the one file. You can edit with as many rows and columns as you wish. Take advantage of multiple monitors by editing with multiple windows, and using multiple splits in each window.

Take a look at the View ▶ Layout menu for split editing options. To open multiple views into the one file, use the File ▶ New View into File menu item.

#### GOTO ANYTHING

Use Goto Anything to open files with only a few keystrokes, and instantly jump to symbols, lines or words.

Triggered with Ctrl+P, it is possible to:

Type part of a file name to open it.
Type @ to jump to symbols, # to search within the file, and : to go to a line number.
These shortcuts can be combined, so tp@rf may take you to a function read_file within a file text_parser.py. Similarly, tp:100 would take you to line 100 of the same file.
